## Steps to clone:

1 . Clone the repository
2.  Run npm install or npm i. You could also Go to package.json and install all dependencies using yarn add pkg_name or npm i pkg_name
3.  Run the script yarn start:dev to run it
4.  Go to localhost:3000 on your browser to see things in action.

## About the Project
Users' feedbacks are a powerful thing for everything in this internet world. Feedbacks have advantages in two perspectives that are **user** perspective and **developer** perspective. Our project aims both perspectives. On the **user perspective**, users want to see most rated, suggested and used products (Apps in our term). How do they get this kind of information easily? Our web app provides solution for this. This web app simply put feedbacks in interactive ways like tables and charts.


On the hand, when we come to the **developer perspective**. Let's suppose you are the product owner of few apps. How do you track the reviews from all different sources- Play store, App Store, Surveys, etc.? OR You wanted to make a mobile app so you have to do research before embarking on the development. Our web app provides the solution for this. We have got you covered. We provide you details about your apps in tabular form and chart form. In the tabular form, you can see the ratings, reviews, score, thums up, date of review, etc and make choices. In the chart form, you could see the trend of your app, like the cumulative ratings, the ratings proportion, comparison with other platforms, etc. 
Ultimately, our app is hub of feeds for all. 


## Protoype

The user needs to login first(not mandatory). Then he(they) has(have) to navigate to the dashboard section and add his preferred apps. After that, he(they) will be presented with the option to analyze data from play store, app store and surveys. They will have the option to analyze the data in tabular form or chart form where they could discover a variety of things as explained above. The user can then make intelligent desicions.

## Challenges and accomplishments

We learnt the art of team work. We were doubtful if we could come up with something but we are glad we did it.

## Next steps

At the moment we are using a kaggle dataset for the reviews and the ratings. We wish to obtain all this from an api which requires registration and all. We also have to make proper provisions for registration and sign-ins(Time was very less, so were not able to implement). We have also plans to integrate the data from machine learning algorithms and the preprocessed data to make accurate predictions which would in turn help the product-app owners to make intelligent choices.
